Research Question and Aim
 How do football matches hosted by Beşiktaş, Fenerbahçe, and Galatasaray impact Istanbul’s traffic density, and what trends emerge from the analysis of match days versus non-match days?
Aim: The purpose of this research is to evaluate traffic density around the stadiums of Istanbul's three major football teams on match days.

Methodology and Approach
1. Descriptive Analysis:
    * A heatmap was used to visualize hourly traffic density trends on weekdays and weekends, providing a baseline for comparison.
    * Match-specific visualizations highlight traffic anomalies during hours surrounding games, differentiating between regular matches and derbies.
2. Visualization Techniques:
    * Bar charts and line graphs illustrate traffic fluctuations during match hours.
    * Comparative charts showcase the differences between derby and non-derby matches.
3. Predictive Modeling:
    * A regression model was developed for each team to predict traffic density on match days.
    * Key features include match time, derby status, day type (weekday/weekend), and national holidays.
