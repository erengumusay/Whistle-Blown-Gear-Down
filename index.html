                <p>This is a research to explore Beşiktaş, Fenerbahçe, and Galatasaray’s football matches’ effects on Istanbul traffic. The main goal is to analyze their daily, hourly and overall affect. We aim to discover key trends and attributes by analyzing time and day based traffic density data within a 50-square-kilometer area centered around each stadium. Our analysis will be conducted from 2 PM to 1 AM to observe match affects better by not getting too far away from their starting time. Ultimately, we hope to answer whether, as many believe, match days are causing significantly more traffic.</p>

            <img src="visuals/heatmap.png" alt="Traffic Density Heatmap">
            <p>This heatmap provides a detailed look at hourly traffic density in Istanbul on both weekdays and weekends. While it is not a visual directly tied to match days, these findings serve as a foundation for our research, its insights are important for better understanding overall traffic picture. By observing how traffic density changes across different times and day types, this visual helps identifying the most jammed hours and provides a clear comparison between weekends and weekdays. Visual shows that:
            <ul>
                <li>Weekends have less traffic flow compared to weekdays.</li>
                <li>Traffic densitys are observed to rise through the afternoon, then gradually decline after reaching their peak.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            </select>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Visual above shows the differentiating behaviours focusing on the hours related to match times for each team. Its main purpose is to reveal anomalies on match days, not to compare overall traffic density. Following the match hours, there is a positive divergence in traffic density compared to non-match days.</p>

            <img src="visuals/vis3.png" alt="Visualization 3">
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">The last visual shows that there is relatively more overall traffic density during the day at derby days compared to non-derby match days. The insights gleaned here complement the previous visuals and provide a clearer picture of how traffic fluctuates in response to major events.</p>

    <div style="margin-top: 20px;">

        <p>Select a team to view its regression visualization:</p>

        </select>
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px;">There is a different model for each team to predict the 'Average daily traffic density on match days'.<br><br>This is because the datasets are not the same and the analyzed area is different, although the structure of the models is the same, they need different constants and coefficients. Regression model is chosen because the target variable, traffic density, is continuous. It provides precise numerical predictions, unlike classification, which categorizes data into predefined groups and is more suitable for binary or multi-class outcomes rather than continuous variables like traffic density.<br><br>A regression formula containing 5 variables is used, which are:
<br><br>Match Time Effect: This is a derived feature that adjusts the influence of match start times on traffic density. It is calculated by measuring how far the match time deviates from 22 PM which is the latest match starting time. Matches closer to afternoon are expected to have a more significant traffic impact, while late-night matches may reduce this effect. This feature improves the model's ability to capture time-specific traffic patterns.<br><br>(match_time_effect)
Derby Status: A binary variable defining if the match is a derby or not.<br><br>(is_derby)
Day Type: Another binary variable indicating if the match is on a weekend or a weekday.<br><br>(is_weekend, is_weekday)
National Holidays: Another binary variable to mark national holidays.<br><br>(is_national_holiday)
Model formulas area as follows for each team.<br><br>
Beşiktaş: y = 3.84 - is_weekend * 0.67 + is_weekday * 0.27 - is_national_holiday * 0.9 + is_derby * 0.2 + match_time_effect.<br>
Fenerbahçe: y = 2.9 - is_weekend * 0.67 + is_weekday * 0.27 - is_national_holiday * 0.9 + is_derby * 0.4 + match_time_effect.<br>
Galatasaray: y = 4.5 - is_weekend * 0.47 + is_weekday * 0.57 - is_national_holiday * 0.9 + is_derby * 0.05 + match_time_effect.<br><br><div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;">
        <img src="visuals/table.png">
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px;">The performance metrics indicate that the models for Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray perform strongly, with R-squared values of 0.88 and 0.90, respectively, showing that they explain a significant portion of the variance in traffic density. Their low Mean Squared Error values (0.0139 for Fenerbahçe and 0.0449 for Galatasaray) reflect minimal prediction errors. In contrast, Beşiktaş's model has a lower R-squared value of 0.42, suggesting it explains less variance in traffic density, and a higher MSE of 0.0487, indicating room for improvement. Bigger scaled research with more variables and larger datasets may be needed for improvement for all models.</p>
